Dynamic DNS
DNSomatic + CloudFlare
At DNS-O-MATIC you must set the following settings:

- Service:        Cloudflare

- E-Mail:         “E-Mail-address which is registered at Cloudflare”

- API Token:      “API Token from Cloudflare”

- Hostname:       dynamic

- Domain:         “yourdomain.xyz”

 

At Cloudflare you must set the following records:

- Type: A     |              Name: dynamic                                |              Value: “your WAN IP” ***

- Type: CNAME |              *                                            |              Value: dynamic.”yourdomain.xyz”

 
*** will later be actualized by DNS-O-MATIC
